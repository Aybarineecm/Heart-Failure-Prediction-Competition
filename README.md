# Heart Failure Prediction Model

This project focuses on the development of a predictive model for heart disease using a dataset of patient records. The ultimate goal is to predict the occurrence of heart disease (`HeartDiease` target column) with high accuracy, leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Objective

To create a robust predictive model that accurately identifies patients at risk of heart disease, using Python and its libraries (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn) for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Tasks Overview

- **Extract Data**: Download and load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Analysis**: 
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and uncover potential features for prediction.
  - Visualize relationships between variables using Matplotlib.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: 
  - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
  - Encode categorical variables suitably.
  - Select relevant features based on the EDA findings.
- **Model Training**: 
  - Choose and train a supervised learning model from the ones covered in the course.
  - Evaluate the model's performance and adjust parameters as necessary.
- **Prediction & Submission**: 
  - Use the trained model to predict heart disease occurrences in the `test.csv` data.
  - Format predictions according to the `sample_submission.csv` file and submit to Kaggle.
